MvUCCU Introductory Guide
========================

> You see, but you do not observe.

A lot of programmers learn by examples, and MvUCCU provides a huge set of example mods to learn from. Unfortunately because MvUCCU's nature as a glue technology, it is hard to decipher the gist of mod writing out of the mess of mostly uncommented code.

This guide aims to provide a basic guide towards writing a MvUCCU mod, and it aims to be complementary to the example mods. While the example mods provide a bottom-up perspective of how a mod is written, this guide enables you a top-down view.
